### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</div>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)
* Your saved folders in the sidebar (created with s/) are now kept between AB3 sessions.  Close AB3, reopen it later and those folders will still be there.
* If you delete a saved folder (with d/), it’s removed from the sidebar and won’t come back on restart.
* Auto folders (the ones the app shows automatically when AB3 is launched are based on tags it finds in addressbook) may disappear when they have no matching people that’s normal cleanup.
  Saved folders don’t vanish on their own, they stay until you delete them.
* Folder names are standardized: 
  * Multi-tag folders are shown in a tidy, consistent format (e.g. colleagues & friends) regardless of the order you typed them. 
  * Duplicate saved folders are ignored, you won’t see the same folder twice.

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Find command

#### Overview
The `find` feature enables insurance agents to search for clients flexibly using multiple keywords and attributes.  
It extends the base AB3 `FindCommand` by supporting **case-insensitive**, **partial matching** across multiple fields: **name**, **phone**, and **email**.

#### Key classes
* `FindCommand` — Executes the search by calling `Model#updateFilteredPersonList(predicate)`.
* `FindCommandParser` — Tokenizes user input and constructs the predicate.
* `ClientMatchesPredicate` — Implements `Predicate<Person>` and encapsulates all matching logic.

#### Behavior
1. User inputs a command such as `find alex 9223`.
2. `LogicManager#execute()` delegates the command string to `AddressBookParser`.
3. `AddressBookParser` recognizes the command word `find` and instantiates a `FindCommandParser`.
4. `FindCommandParser` tokenizes the keywords (`["alex", "9223"]`) and constructs a `ClientMatchesPredicate` object (`p`) that:
    - Ignores blank keywords.
    - Performs **null-safe** access to person fields.
    - Returns `true` if **any** keyword appears in the person's name, phone, or email.
5. A new `FindCommand` object is created with `p` and executed by the `LogicManager`.
6. During execution, `Model#updateFilteredPersonList(p)` is invoked.
7. The model filters the in-memory client list using `ClientMatchesPredicate#test(Person)`, returning all clients that match any of the keywords.

#### Sequence diagram
The following diagram illustrates how the `find` command is processed when a user inputs `find alex 9223`.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `find` Command](images/FindSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:**  
The `ClientMatchesPredicate` instance (`p`) is created once and passed to both the `FindCommand` and `Model`.  
This design ensures predictable, stateless filtering and encapsulates all keyword-matching logic within a single class.
</div>

#### Example
| User Input       | Description                                                                    |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `find alex`      | Lists all clients whose name, phone, or email contains “alex”                  |
| `find alex 9223` | Lists all clients whose name, phone, or email contains either “alex” or “9223” |
| `find @gmail`    | Lists all clients with a Gmail address                                         |

#### Design considerations
**Aspect: Matching strategy**
* Use a single `ClientMatchesPredicate` that internally loops through keywords and fields.
    * Pros: Simpler to maintain, easy to test, less object overhead.

### Clear feature

Clear feature is implemented via `ClearCommand` class. When the user issues the `clear` command, an instance of `ClearCommand` is created and its `execute` method is called. This method interacts with the `Model` component to remove all entries from the address book. The `Model` provides a method `clearAddressBook()` which is invoked by the `ClearCommand` to perform the actual clearing of data. After clearing, a confirmation message is returned to inform the user that the address book has been successfully cleared.
When executed, the `ClearCommand` will save a copy of the current state of the address book to facilitate the undo feature.
![Clear Sequence Diagram](images/ClearCommandSequenceDiagram.png)

### Biz feature

Biz feature is implemented via `BizTagCommand` class. When the user inputs `biz f/Plan t/A t/B`, an instance of `BizTagCommand` is created and its `execute` method is called.
The object then creates a `FeatureTag` with `tagName` Plan and a `Set<Tag>` containing `Tag`s of `tagName`s A and B. It then passes the `FeatureTag` and `Set<Tag>` into `Model` via the `addBizTags()` method in `Model`.
The object then returns a `String` message to the user about the successful addition. If that Feature already exists in `Model`, this will overwrite that Feature : Tag pair. 

![Biz Sequence Diagram](images/BizSequenceDiagram.png)

### Unbiz feature

Unbiz feature is implemented via `BizUntagCommand` class. When the user inputs `unbiz f/Plan f/Gender`, an instance of `BizUntagCommand` is created and its `execute` method is called.
The object does the following:
* Check if the Feature after each `f/` exists in `Model` via the `isBizFeature()` method in `Model`. If there are Features that do not exist in `Model`, this command fails and tells the User which Features are missing.
* Else, for each Feature remove them and their Tags from `Model` via the `removeBizFeature()` method in `Model`. Then it returns to the User a `String` confirmation of the removal operation done with which Feature and Tags pair have been removed.

The implementation of the feature is atomic - either all inputted Features get removed or none gets removed. Hence, reducing unexpected changes to the `bizTags` structure in `Model`.
![Biz Sequence Diagram](images/UnbizSequenceDiagram.png)

### Stats feature

Stats feature in implemented via the `StatsCommand` class. When the user issues the `stats` command, an instance of `StatsCommand` is created and its `execute` method is called. This method interacts with the `Model` component to obtain declared Features and their respective Tags from `bizTags` using the `get_BizTags()` method in `Model`. It will then aggregate statistics such as Average, Min and Max for each Feature using its own `getFeatureStats()` method and return the output as a `String` through the `CommandResult` object.
This feature is not undoable.
![Stats_Sequence_Diagram](images/StatsSequenceDiagram.png)

### Undo/redo feature
 
Undo and redo features are implemented using the Command Pattern along with a stack-based approach to track executed commands. Each command that modifies the state of the address book (e.g., add, delete, edit) implements an `undo()` and `redo()` method.

When a mutable command is executed, it is pushed onto an `undoStack`. 
If the user issues an `undo` command, the most recent command is popped from the `undoStack`, its `undo()` method is called to revert the changes, and it is then pushed onto a `redoStack`. 
Conversely, when a `redo` command is issued, the most recent command from the `redoStack` is popped, its `execute(m)` method is called to reapply the changes, and it is pushed back onto the `undoStack`.

The `undo` function in a command will do the opposite of what the `execute` function does.
For example, the `undo` function for the `ClearCommand` will restore all previously deleted entries back into the address book.

Using clear command as an example, the sequence diagram below illustrates how the `undo` feature works:
![Undo Clear Sequence Diagram](images/UndoCommandSequenceDiagram.png)

Using clear command as an example, the sequence diagram below illustrates how the `redo` command works after an `undo` of the clear command has been executed:
![Undo Clear Sequence Diagram](images/RedoCommandSequenceDiagram.png)

### Tag Folder Feature
The Tag Folder feature allows users to organize contacts based on tags (e.g., “friend”, “family”, “work”) and display them as folders in the sidebar.
* When a user executes a command with tags (e.g., list t/A t/friend):
* The command is parsed into a ListCommand object by the AddressBookParser.
* The command filters the person list by the specified tags and updates the sidebar with corresponding tag folders.
* The Model component, via ModelManager, manages the active tag folders
    * It deduplicates tag names (case-insensitive).
    * Creates or updates TagFolder objects.
    * Refreshes tag folder counts for display.

This process is facilitated through methods like:
* addActiveTagFolders(List<String> tagNames)
* setActiveTagFolders(List<String> tagNames)
* refreshActiveTagFolderCounts()
