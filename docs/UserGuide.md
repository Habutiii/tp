<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">
<strong>:information_source: Notes:</strong>
<code>INDEX</code> refers to the number shown in the <strong>current list view</strong>, not a fixed ID.<br>
If you used <code>find</code> or <code>list</code> before, <code>edit 1</code> edits the first result from that filtered list.
</div>

**Description**

* Edits the person at the specified `INDEX` in the currently displayed list.

  * To remove all tags, type `t/` with nothing after it.
  * Only one unique tag operation (t/, at/, or dt/) can be used per command. (See examples below)
    * The selected unique tag operation can be repeated multiple times in the same command to add/remove multiple tags.
* Each person can have up to **15 tags** after editing.
* **Parameter restrictions:** Same as those in the [`add`](#adding-a-person-add) command.

### Locating persons by name: `find`

Finds clients whose **name, phone number, or email** contain any of the given keywords (case-insensitive, partial matches allowed).
Format: `find KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]`

**Description**

- The search is **case-insensitive**.  
  Example: `hans` matches `Hans`, `HANS`, and `Johanssen`.
- **Partial matches** are supported.  
  Example: `li` matches `David Li`, `Lina Tan`, and `charlie@gmail.com`.
- Searches across **name**, **phone**, and **email** fields.
- Keyword order **does not matter**.  
  Example: `Alex 9123` matches clients whose name contains “Alex” or phone contains “9123”.
- Uses **OR semantics** — a client is listed if **any** keyword matches any field.
- Blank or invalid inputs (e.g., spaces only or non-printable Unicode) are ignored safely.

**Examples**

| Command                    | Description / Result                                                |

Format: `biz f/<your feature here> t/<tag 1> t/<tag 2>`

* Add multiple tags fro aggregation of a Feature.

Examples: [See result in 'Viewing Summary Statistics']
* `biz f/Plan t/A t/B t/C` declares the Feature "Plan" and the Categories "A", "B" and "C" for statistics.
* `biz f/Gender t/Male t/Female t/Other` declares this Feature and its Categories.

**Parameter restrictions:**
***All parameters contains only printable ASCII characters***
- **Feature and Tag:** A tag name should contain only English letters, digits, or '-' (dash). It must start and end with a letter or digit, and must not exceed 40 characters. Tags are case-insensitive.
  _Example: friend, VIP, family-member, project2025_


### Undeclaring Features and Tags from Statistics: `unbiz`

Undeclares Features and their corresponding Tags.
This command is undoable.

Format: `unbiz f/<your feature 1 here> f/<your feature 2 here>`

* Undeclare multiple Features by chaining `f/` prefixes together.

Examples:
* `biz f/Plan` undeclares the Feature "Plan" and its associated tags from statistics.
* `biz f/Gender f/Plan` undeclares these Features: "Plan", "Gender".

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">
:exclamation: **Caution: Parameter restrictions**

A `Feature` and `Tag` name should contain only English letters, digits, or '-' (dash). It must start and end with a letter or digit, and must not exceed 40 characters. Tags are case-insensitive.

Key - Features: Tags
* Plan: A, B, C -> `biz f/Plan t/A t/B t/C` (Where f/ is the name of the group in this case it is "Plan" and the tags associated with it is A, B and C).
* Gender: Male, Female, Other -> `biz f/Gender t/Male t/Female t/Other` (Where f/ is the name of the group in this case it is "Gender" and the tags associated with it is Male, Female and Other).

### Undoing the last action : `undo`

Reverts the most recent mutable action (`add`, `delete`, `clear`, `edit`, `biz`, `unbiz`, or `list` with `s/` or `d/` flags) performed during the current runtime.

Format: `undo`

* Only actions that change the address book or saved folders (`add`, `delete`, `clear`, `edit`, `biz`, `unbiz`, `list t/... s/`, or `list t/... d/`) can be undone.
* Multiple undo operations can be performed in sequence to revert several actions, as long as they are all mutable actions.
* Undo is only available for actions performed in the current runtime.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">
<strong>:information_source: Tip:</strong><br>
There is no limit on how many actions can be undone, as long as they were performed in the current runtime.
</div>

**Examples:**
* After adding a person, running `undo` will remove the newly added person.
* After deleting a person, running `undo` will restore the deleted person.
* After editing a person, running `undo` will revert the changes made.
* After clearing the address book, running `undo` will restore all previously deleted entries.
* After declaring a feature using `biz`, running `undo` will revert that declaration.
* After undeclaring a feature using `unbiz`, running `undo` will restore the previously removed feature.
* After creating a saved folder using `list t/friends t/colleagues s/`, running `undo` will remove that saved folder.
* After deleting a saved folder using `list t/friends t/colleagues d/`, running `undo` will restore that folder.

---

### Redoing the last undone action : `redo`

Reapplies the most recent undone action, as long as no new action has been performed since the last undo.

Format: `redo`

* Only actions that were previously undone using `undo` can be redone.
* If you perform a new action (`add`, `delete`, `clear`, `edit`, `biz`, `unbiz`, or `list` with `s/` or `d/`) after undoing, the redo history is cleared and you cannot redo the previous actions.
* Multiple redo operations can be performed consecutively to reapply several undone actions, as long as no new action interrupts the sequence.
* Redo is only available for actions undone in the current runtime.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">
<strong>:information_source: Tip:</strong>
Redo can only be used immediately after an <code>undo</code>.  
Once a new action is performed, the redo history is cleared.
</div>

**Examples:**
* After undoing an add, running `redo` will add the person back again.
* After undoing a delete, running `redo` will delete the person again.
* After undoing an edit, running `redo` will re-apply the same edits.
* After undoing a biz, running `redo` will restore the declared feature.
* After undoing a saved folder creation (`list t/friends s/`), running `redo` will re-create that folder.
* After undoing a saved folder deletion (`list t/friends d/`), running `redo` will delete that folder again.
* If you undo an edit and then perform a new add, you cannot redo the undone edit.

### Saving the data

Ethical Insurance address book data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

#### Data recovery & backup

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">
:exclamation: **Caution:** If the data file becomes invalid or corrupted, Ethical Insurance will **discard the file and start with an empty dataset** on the next run. Keep periodic backups so you can restore quickly.
</div>

**Where is my data stored?**  
`[JAR location]/data/addressbook.json`

**How do I back up my data?**
1. Exit the app.
2. Copy `data/addressbook.json` to a safe folder (e.g., `backups/addressbook-YYYYMMDD.json`).

**How do I restore my data from a backup?**
1. Exit the app.
2. Replace `[JAR location]/data/addressbook.json` with your backup copy. Ensure that the name is `addressbook.json`.
3. Start the app again.

#### Editing the data file manually

**Advanced users:**
- You may edit `addressbook.json` directly, but only with a plain-text editor and **printable ASCII**.
- Any invalid structure (e.g., missing commas/quotes) will cause the app to reset the file. Always keep a backup before editing.

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous Ethical Insurance home folder.

**Q**: Why when I issue add/edit command, something appears on the right side of the application?<br>
**A**: When issuing an add or edit command, a live preview of what you are adding or editing will appear on the right side of your screen. This allows you to quickly verify that the information you entered is correct. When an invalid field is detected (e.g., `n/X Æ A-12`), that field will be highlighted in red to indicate an error. Currently, duplicate users are not flagged (coming soon!).

## Minimum Window Size and Display Scaling

Ethical Insurance’s user interface is designed to remain clear and fully functional across standard screen sizes and scaling levels.

### Recommended display settings

The application has been tested to work optimally under the following conditions:

- **Screen resolutions:** 1920×1080 and higher
- **Scaling levels:** 100% and 125%

### Minimum supported configuration

While the interface remains usable (all features accessible, though with reduced comfort) under smaller resolutions and higher scaling, the minimum supported setup is:

| Physical Resolution | Scale | Effective Logical Resolution | Usability                      |
|---------------------|-------|------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| 1920×1080 @ 100%    | 1.00  | 1920×1080                    | ✅ Optimal                      |
| 1920×1080 @ 125%    | 1.25  | 1536×864                     | ✅ Good                         |
| 1280×720 @ 150%     | 1.50  | 853×480                      | ⚠️ Usable (reduced visibility) |

### Minimum window size

The Ethical Insurance application enforces a **minimum window size of 450 × 800 pixels** to prevent layout distortion or clipping of key UI elements.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">
<strong>:information_source: Tip:</strong>
If the interface appears cramped at higher scaling levels (e.g., 150%), resize the window manually or lower the display scaling in your operating system settings.
</div>

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
3. **Overflowing tags during rapid window resizing**

In rare cases, when the window is resized very quickly (e.g., by dragging the window edges repeatedly), certain UI components such as tags may appear **visually misaligned or overflow** their containers, as shown below:

![Example of overflowing tags](images/OverflowingTags.png)

This behavior occurs due to how the **JavaFX listener** internally handles rapid UI layout updates during resizing events.  
It does **not affect data integrity or application functionality**, and only causes temporary visual distortion.

**Workarounds:**
- Resize the window normally instead of dragging edges rapidly.
- If the overflow occurs, simply **resize the window again**; The layout will automatically correct itself.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">
<strong>:information_source: Note:</strong>
This issue is a limitation of JavaFX’s layout refresh mechanism during fast window resize events.  
It is cosmetic and does not impact stored data or usability.
