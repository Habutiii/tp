## Commands

This section explains how to read and use command syntax throughout the User Guide

### Viewing Manuals: `man`

Display help manual for commands.

Format: `man [COMMAND]`
* If `COMMAND` is not specified, shows a list of all available commands.
* If `COMMAND` is specified, shows the manual for the command.
* If multiple inputs are entered (e.g., man list help), only the first valid command (list) will be processed, and everything else after the first space will be ignored.

---

### Viewing help : `help`

Shows a message explaining how to access the help page.

![help message](images/helpMessage.png)

Format: `help`

---

### Listing all persons : `list`

Lists all entries in the address book.

Format: `list`

**Filtered list by tag : `list t/<your tag here>`**

Filter by the respective tag(s) entered and displays a list of the filtered entries.

Format: `list t/<your tag here>` and for multiple tags `list t/<your tag here> t/<your tag here> ...`
Example: 
- `list t/friends`
- `list t/travel t/high-cost`
- `list t/car t/medical t/expensive`


**Create folder by tag : `list t/<your tag here> s/`**

Saves the current tag selection as a sidebar folder.

Format: `list t/<your tag here> s/` and for multiple tags `list t/<your tag here> t/<your tag here> ... s/`
- s/ is a flag, not a value. Anything typed after the first s/ is ignored.
- The folder name is the selected tags sorted alphabetically and joined with & (e.g. t/friends t/colleagues s/ → colleagues & friends).
- You can type s/ more than once, but extra s/ flags are ignored.
- Tag order in the command doesn’t matter (the saved name is always alphabetical).
- Tags are now normalized to all uppercase

Example:
- Input: `list t/friends t/colleagues s/`
- Output: Folder `COLLEAGUES & FRIENDS` created
- `list t/friends t/colleagues s/ notes here` → same result (text after s/ ignored)

**Delete folder by tag : `list t/<your tag here> d/`**

Deletes the saved folder that exactly matches the given tag set.

Format: `list t/<your tag here> d/` and for folders based multiple tags  `list t/<your tag here> t/<your tag here> ... d/`
- d/ is a flag. Anything typed after the first d/ is ignored. 
- Tag order doesn’t matter; the folder is matched by its tag set, not the order (e.g. t/family t/friends d/ deletes family & friends). 
- Only one folder is deleted per command. Adding more tags just helps specify the one folder you mean. 
- You can type d/ more than once, but extra d/ flags are ignored.

Example
- Input: `list t/cars d/`
- Output: Deleted folder `"CARS"`
- Input: `list t/cars t/medical t/age d/`
- Output: Deleted folder `"AGE & CARS & MEDICAL"`

---

### Adding a person: `add`
>All parameters must contain only printable ASCII characters.

</div>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">

### Locating persons by name: `find`

Finds clients whose **name, phone number, or email** contain any of the given keywords (case-insensitive, partial matches allowed).

### Declaring Features and Tags for Statistics: `biz`

Declares Features and Tags to group Tags by Features for statistics. Adding those Categories as tags to People will allow them to be considered for [statistics](#viewing-summary-statistics-stats).
Applying this command on a Feature with the same name will overwrite the existing Feature-Tags pair. This command is undoable.

**Disclaimer:** These feature-tag relations do not persist after this app closes or is restarted.

Format: `biz f/<your feature here> t/<tag 1> t/<tag 2>`

* Add multiple tags for aggregation of a Feature.

Examples: [See result in 'Viewing Summary Statistics'](#viewing-summary-statistics-stats) `biz f/Plan t/A t/B t/C` declares the Feature "Plan" and the Categories "A", "B" and "C" for statistics.
* `biz f/Gender t/Male t/Female t/Other` declares this Feature and its Categories.

**Parameter restrictions:**
**All parameters must contain only printable ASCII characters**
- **Please note that Biz tags are different from the entry Tags above.**
- **Feature and Tag:** A tag name should contain only English letters, digits, or '-' (dash). It must start and end with a letter or digit, and must not exceed 40 characters. Tags are case-insensitive. 
 _Example: friend, VIP, family-member, project2025_


### Undeclaring Features and Tags from Statistics: `unbiz`

Undeclares Features and their corresponding Tags.
This command is undoable.

Format: `unbiz f/<your feature 1 here> f/<your feature 2 here>`

* Undeclare multiple Features by chaining `f/` prefixes together.

Examples:
* `unbiz f/Plan` undeclares the Feature "Plan" and its associated tags from statistics.
* `unbiz f/Gender f/Plan` undeclares these Features: "Plan", "Gender".

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">
:exclamation: **Caution: Parameter restrictions**

A `Feature` and `Tag` name for <code>biz</code> and <code>unbiz</code> commands should contain only English letters, digits, or '-' (dash). It must start and end with a letter or digit, and must not exceed 40 characters. Tags are case-insensitive.  
<br>
_Example: friend, VIP, family-member, project2025_

</div>

### Viewing Summary Statistics: `stats`

Shows Summary Statistics on Customers in Ethical Insurance.

Statistics will be summarized according to Features and Tags declared by User using the `biz` command. This ensures that statistics concerning specific features of customers are aggregated for the user - user may want to reserve some tags for statistics while others for pure organisation of the people in the address book of Ethical Insurance.

If there are ties when deciding the Max and Min tags in the summary tables, all the tags associated with the tie will be displayed, according to whether they tied in Max Tag and/or Min Tag.

If there are no declared features and tags, `stats` will only show the total number of customers in the address book.

Refer to **Disclaimer** in [`biz`](#declaring-features-and-tags-for-statistics-biz) command for information on feature-tag persistency.

Format: `stats`

**Example:**
If the following was declared in `biz` command,

Key - Features: Tags
* Plan: A, B, C -> `biz f/Plan t/A t/B t/C` (Where f/ is the name of the group in this case it is "Plan" and the tags associated with it is A, B and C).

### Undoing the last action : `undo`

Reverts the most recent mutable action (`add`, `delete`, `clear`, `edit`, `biz`, `unbiz`, or `list` with `s/` or `d/` flags) performed during the current runtime.

Format: `undo`

* Only actions that change the address book or saved folders (`add`, `delete`, `clear`, `edit`, `biz`, `unbiz`, `list t/... s/`, or `list t/... d/`) can be undone.
* Multiple undo operations can be performed in sequence to revert several actions, as long as they are all mutable actions.
* Undo is only available for actions performed in the current runtime.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">
<strong>:information_source: Tip:</strong><br>
There is no limit on how many actions can be undone, as long as they were performed in the current runtime.
</div>

**Examples:**
* After adding a person, running `undo` will remove the newly added person.
* After deleting a person, running `undo` will restore the deleted person.
* After editing a person, running `undo` will revert the changes made.
* After clearing the address book, running `undo` will restore all previously deleted entries.
* After declaring a feature using `biz`, running `undo` will revert that declaration.
* After undeclaring a feature using `unbiz`, running `undo` will restore the previously removed feature.
* After creating a saved folder using `list t/friends t/colleagues s/`, running `undo` will remove that saved folder.
* After deleting a saved folder using `list t/friends t/colleagues d/`, running `undo` will restore that folder.

---

### Redoing the last undone action : `redo`

Reapplies the most recent undone action, as long as no new action has been performed since the last undo.

Format: `redo`

* Only actions that were previously undone using `undo` can be redone.
* If you perform a new action (`add`, `delete`, `clear`, `edit`, `biz`, `unbiz`, or `list` with `s/` or `d/`) after undoing, the redo history is cleared and you cannot redo the previous actions.
* Multiple redo operations can be performed consecutively to reapply several undone actions, as long as no new action interrupts the sequence.
* Redo is only available for actions undone in the current runtime.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">
<strong>:information_source: Tip:</strong>
Redo can only be used immediately after an <code>undo</code>.  
Once a new action is performed, the redo history is cleared.
</div>

**Examples:**
* After undoing an add, running `redo` will add the person back again.
* After undoing a delete, running `redo` will delete the person again.
* After undoing an edit, running `redo` will re-apply the same edits.
* After undoing a biz, running `redo` will restore the declared feature.
* After undoing a saved folder creation (`list t/friends s/`), running `redo` will re-create that folder.
* After undoing a saved folder deletion (`list t/friends d/`), running `redo` will delete that folder again.
* If you undo an edit and then perform a new add, you cannot redo the undone edit.

### Saving the data

Ethical Insurance address book data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

#### Data recovery & backup

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">
:exclamation: **Caution:** If the data file becomes invalid or corrupted, Ethical Insurance will **discard the file and start with an empty dataset** on the next run. Keep periodic backups so you can restore quickly.
</div>

**Where is my data stored?**  
`[JAR location]/data/addressbook.json`

**How do I back up my data?**
1. Exit the app.
2. Copy `data/addressbook.json` to a safe folder (e.g., `backups/addressbook-YYYYMMDD.json`).

**How do I restore my data from a backup?**
1. Exit the app.
2. Replace `[JAR location]/data/addressbook.json` with your backup copy. Ensure that the name is `addressbook.json`.
3. Start the app again.

#### Editing the data file manually

**Advanced users:**
- You may edit `addressbook.json` directly, but only with a plain-text editor and **printable ASCII**.
- Any invalid structure (e.g., missing commas/quotes) will cause the app to reset the file. Always keep a backup before editing.

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous Ethical Insurance home folder.

**Q**: Why when I issue add/edit command, something appears on the right side of the application?<br>
**A**: When issuing an add or edit command, a live preview of what you are adding or editing will appear on the right side of your screen. This allows you to quickly verify that the information you entered is correct. When an invalid field is detected (e.g., `n/X Æ A-12`), that field will be highlighted in red to indicate an error. Currently, duplicate users are not flagged (coming soon!).

## Minimum Window Size and Display Scaling

Ethical Insurance’s user interface is designed to remain clear and fully functional across standard screen sizes and scaling levels.

### Recommended display settings

The application has been tested to work optimally under the following conditions:

- **Screen resolutions:** 1920×1080 and higher
- **Scaling levels:** 100% and 125%

### Minimum supported configuration

While the interface remains usable (all features accessible, though with reduced comfort) under smaller resolutions and higher scaling, the minimum supported setup is:

| Physical Resolution | Scale | Effective Logical Resolution | Usability                      |
|---------------------|-------|------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| 1920×1080 @ 100%    | 1.00  | 1920×1080                    | ✅ Optimal                      |
| 1920×1080 @ 125%    | 1.25  | 1536×864                     | ✅ Good                         |
| 1280×720 @ 150%     | 1.50  | 853×480                      | ⚠️ Usable (reduced visibility) |

### Minimum window size

The Ethical Insurance application enforces a **minimum window size of 450 × 800 pixels** to prevent layout distortion or clipping of key UI elements.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">
<strong>:information_source: Tip:</strong>
If the interface appears cramped at higher scaling levels (e.g., 150%), resize the window manually or lower the display scaling in your operating system settings.
</div>

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
3. **Overflowing tags during rapid window resizing**

In rare cases, when the window is resized very quickly (e.g., by dragging the window edges repeatedly), certain UI components such as tags may appear **visually misaligned or overflow** their containers, as shown below:

![Example of overflowing tags](images/OverflowingTags.png)

This behavior occurs due to how the **JavaFX listener** internally handles rapid UI layout updates during resizing events.  
It does **not affect data integrity or application functionality**, and only causes temporary visual distortion.

**Workarounds:**
- Resize the window normally instead of dragging edges rapidly.
- If the overflow occurs, simply **resize the window again**; The layout will automatically correct itself.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">
<strong>:information_source: Note:</strong>
This issue is a limitation of JavaFX’s layout refresh mechanism during fast window resize events.  
It is cosmetic and does not impact stored data or usability.
