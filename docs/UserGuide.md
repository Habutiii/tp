Edits an existing person in the address book.

Format: `edit INDEX [n/NAME] [p/PHONE] [e/EMAIL] [a/ADDRESS] [{t/ OR at/ OR dt/}TAG]…​`

> 💡 `INDEX` refers to the number shown in the **current list view**, not a fixed ID.

> 💡 Example: if you use `find` first, `edit 1` edits the first result from that filtered list.
Editing is **undoable** using the [`undo`](#undoing-the-last-action-undo) command.


#### Description
* Edits the person at the specified `INDEX`. The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed person list. The index **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, …​
* At least one of the optional fields must be provided.
* Existing values will be updated to the input values.
* When using `t/TAG`, the existing tags of the person will be removed.
* Use `at/TAG` to add on to **existing** tags.
* Use `dt/TAG` to remove from **existing** tags.
* You can only use either of these tag editing commands once per `edit` command.
* You can remove all the person’s tags by typing `t/` without
  specifying any tags after it.
* Each person after editing can only contain a maximum of 15 tags.

Examples:
*  `edit 1 p/91234567 e/johndoe@example.com` Edits the phone number and email address of the 1st person to be `91234567` and `johndoe@example.com` respectively.
*  `edit 2 n/Betsy Crower t/` Edits the name of the 2nd person to be `Betsy Crower` and clears all existing tags.
*  `edit 3 at/InsuranceA` Adds the tag `InsuranceA` on to existing tags of the 3rd person.
*  `edit 3 dt/InsuranceA` Deletes the tag `InsuranceA` from the existing tags of the 3rd person.

- Edits the person at the specified **`INDEX`** in the currently displayed list.  
  The index **must be a positive integer** (1, 2, 3, …).
- At least **one** of the optional fields must be provided.
- Only the specified fields are updated, other fields remain unchanged.
- When editing tags, the existing tags are **replaced**, not added cumulatively.
- To remove **all** of a person’s tags, type `t/` with nothing following it.
- Each person can have up to **15 tags** after editing.
- **Parameter restrictions:** Same as those in the [`add`](#adding-a-person-add) command.

### Locating persons by name: `find`

Finds clients whose **name, phone number, or email** contain any of the given keywords (case-insensitive, partial matches allowed).
Format: `find KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]`

---

**Description**

- The search is **case-insensitive**.  
  Example: `hans` matches `Hans`, `HANS`, and `Johanssen`.
- **Partial matches** are supported.  
  Example: `li` matches `David Li`, `Lina Tan`, and `charlie@gmail.com`.
- Searches across **name**, **phone**, and **email** fields.
- Keyword order **does not matter**.  
  Example: `Alex 9123` matches clients whose name contains “Alex” or phone contains “9123”.
- Uses **OR semantics** — a client is listed if **any** keyword matches any field.
- Blank or invalid inputs (e.g., spaces only or non-printable Unicode) are ignored safely.

### Undoing the last action : `undo`

Reverts the most recent mutable action (add, delete, clear, or edit) performed during the current runtime.

Format: `undo`

* Only actions that change the address book (add, delete, clear, edit, biz, unbiz) can be undone.
* Multiple undo operations can be performed in sequence to revert several actions, as long as they are all mutable actions from the current session.
* Undo is only available for actions performed since the application was started (current runtime).

**Examples:**
* After adding a person, running `undo` will remove the newly added person.
* After deleting a person, running `undo` will restore the deleted person.
* After editing a person, running `undo` will revert the changes made.
* After clearing the address book, running `undo` will restore all previously deleted entries.

---

### Redoing the last undone action : `redo`

Reapplies the most recent sequence of undone mutable actions, as long as no new action has been performed since the last undo.

Format: `redo`

* Only actions that were previously undone using `undo` can be redone.
* If you perform a new action (add, delete, clear, edit) after undoing, the redo history is cleared and you cannot redo the previous actions.
* Multiple redo operations can be performed in sequence to reapply several undone actions, as long as no new action has interrupted the sequence.

**Examples:**
* After undoing an add, running `redo` will add the person back again.
* After undoing a delete, running `redo` will delete the person again.
* If you undo an edit and then perform a new add, you cannot redo the undone edit.

---

### Exiting the program : `exit`

Exits the program.

Format: `exit`

---

### Saving the data

Ethical Insurance address book data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

---

### Editing the data file

Ethical Insurance address book data are saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/addressbook.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, Ethical Insurance will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run, *without any warning*. Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause Ethical Insurance to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside of the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.
</div>

### Archiving data files `[coming in v2.0]`

_Details coming soon ..._

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous Ethical Insurance home folder.

**Q**: Why when I issue add/edit command, something appears on the right side of the application?<br>
**A**: When issuing an add or edit command, a live preview of what you are adding or editing will appear on the right side of your screen. This allows you to quickly verify that the information you entered is correct. When an invalid field is detected (e.g., `n/X Æ A-12`), that field will be highlighted in red to indicate an error. Currently, duplicate users are not flagged (coming soon!).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
