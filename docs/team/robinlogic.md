### Project: Ethical Insurance

Ethical Insurance is a modernized version of AddressBook-Level 3, re-imagined as a lightweight desktop contact management tool tailored for independent insurance agents managing 0 – 1000 customer entries.

Given below are my contributions to the project.
* **Code Contributions**
  * Implemented the stats command, enabling users to view summary statistics of the address book. 
  * Displays overall customer count, per-feature tag breakdowns (e.g. Gender, Plan), and average/max/min values for each category. 
  * Designed the statistics engine to integrate dynamically with user-declared features and tags. 
  * Developed the biz and unbiz command system for declaring and undeclaring feature–tag groupings used by the statistics module. 
  * Supported undo/redo, command documentation (man), and ensured full compatibility with the existing model layer. 
  * Implemented input validation and comprehensive test coverage to ensure consistency between declared and undeclared features. 
  * Extended the edit command to support adding and deleting tags via new prefixes (at/, dt/). 
  * Updated the EditPreviewBuilder to visually highlight tag-related validation errors and enforce the maximum tag limit. 
  * Added targeted JUnit tests to verify tag addition/removal behavior, error messaging, and preview validation. 
  * Refactored shared components to improve code readability, command extensibility, and preview consistency across the command suite.
* **Documentation**:
    * Contributed to User Guide (UG) and Developer Guide (DG) by documenting biz, unbiz, and stats commands. 
      * Created UML sequence diagrams in the DG to illustrate command flow and interactions. 
      * Ensured all documentation aligns with project standards, making it easier for future developers to extend or maintain features.
